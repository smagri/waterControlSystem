Ultrasonic.ino needs to be in  directory Ultrasonic in current working
directory,  so arduino  ide creates  it once  you open  the .ino  file
within it for the first time.

Lib_IM120628012_HC_SR04.zip - hc-sr04 ultrasonic sensor library .zip
needs to be loaded via:

Sketch->Add Library->Lib_IM120628012_HC_SR04.zip

This then puts the sensor .cpp .h files into Preferences->Sketchbook
location, in this case it is:
/lu1/smagri/Arduino/sketches/libraries/Ultrasonic

Using snap version of arduino ide so libraries are here:
/home/smagri/snap/arduino/current/Arduino/libraries


Lib_IM120628012_HC_SR04.zip    contains    example   HC_SR04    serial
port(Ultrasonic.ino) and LCD ouput code(UltrasonicDemo1.ino).  Renamed
UltrasonicDemo.pde.lcdComms  and   Ultrasonic.ino.serialComms  by  me.
Both       are       combined       by       me       to       produce
Ultrasonic.distanSensorLCD/Ultrasonic.ino, used  to program  the kicad
distansensorSensor.
