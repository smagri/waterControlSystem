Could not easily  work out howto get  the input from the  Text box for
the name  of the serial  port, so I implemented  it as a  command line
argument for now.  Perhaps I need to use TextLineEdit()

Perhaps need to experiment with combo box, see inline code for a start.

Web  pages used/read  to create  code should  be saved  in Evernote  I
think, otherwise google  again as I didn't save them  here.  Have been
trying to use Evernote  more but maybe this was a  wrong choise in the
end as it locks me in to them.  I could export the clipped addless web
pages, the strength  and why I use evernote, but  I think sometimes it
doesn't export them properly and saving the web pages with adds on the
hard drive results  in unreadable pdf's anyhow.  However,  I think the
plan was to use evernote for note taking at uni.

see: Paul McWhorder video:
Using an Arduino with Python lesson 3:
      * println() addes \r\n, ie CR and LF to end of data line.
      * could deal with this via, try this in dsuLCDpyqt5.py at some point:

readDataStr = str(readDataStr, 'utf-8')
readDataStr = readDatastr.strip('\r\n')
