Thinking on how the plot of data is going to happen:

Plots:

All level  values read from  the serial port  are recored into  a file
with  a   UTC/'seconds  since  the  epoch'  time   stamp.  Tank  Level
measurments are taken once every hour.

Resolution of one day(as per maquarie uni app).

User chooses, via calendar widget, the startDay and endDay.

Callback/s  for  calendar  widgets  set  startDay  and  endDay  global
variables.

updatePlotLevel() uses startDay &  endDay to malloc() an appropriately
sized  region  for  the  level  data.   Search  the  logfile  for  the
timestamps required, read in these  level values, and fill this region
with data, ready for plotting.

When  updatePlotLevel() is  called a  2nd or  more times  you  need to
free() the  previously malloc()'ed  area and malloc()  a new  area the
size of all the data for the next plot.

By default  the most  recent full  day of data  is plotted  on program
startup.

If an invalid  date range is entered...print 'we do  not have data for
for those dates.'

Currently the plot  displays a Marker, Curve and  Grid.  Note that the
curve can only have one marker, plotting the next marker overrides the
previous  marker.  Also  the curve  plot must  have two  or  more data
points, QwtCurvePlot  does not allow you  to plot only one  value at a
time, cause it's  a curve plotting thing I  guess.  However, you could
plot one x,y value by filling the array with two values the same.
